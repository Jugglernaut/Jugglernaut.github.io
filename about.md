# About

Hi, I'm Stephen O'Brien - a software developer exploring deep learning. I'll be creating posts about my frustrations (and hopefully, my successes) learning python, fast.ai, and other technologies. I do hope that as I get better, I'll be able to go back and revise my posts with updates so that others following this path might have some headaches solved for them!
